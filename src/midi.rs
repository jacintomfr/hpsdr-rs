//! MIDI control-surface support: any class-compliant MIDI controller's
//! notes/CCs/pitch-bend can be "learned" (Settings -> MIDI) and bound to a
//! radio action.
//!
//! Split the way piHPSDR's own MIDI support is split (this project's own
//! author has maintained that split for years: midi.h/midi2.c/midi_menu.c),
//! but collapsed from three layers into two pieces:
//!
//! - Layer 1 (this module): hardware I/O only. `MidiWorker` owns a `midir`
//!   connection, (re)connecting by device name every ~1s since neither
//!   ALSA/CoreMIDI/WinMM nor `midir` itself gives an unplug/replug
//!   notification -- a controller that comes back after a cable wiggle
//!   must reconnect without the operator doing anything. Raw bytes are
//!   parsed into a `RawMidiEvent` and pushed onto a bounded, drop-oldest
//!   queue; nothing here knows what a "binding" or an "action" is.
//! - Layers 2 (binding lookup) and 3 (action dispatch) live in main.rs's
//!   existing per-frame loop, which drains that queue. This follows the
//!   same "background thread writes an intent, the frame loop drains and
//!   acts" convention this codebase already uses for CAT/rigctl's
//!   cw_remote_pending queue (see rigctl.rs's own module doc comment) --
//!   there's no need for this thread to hold a clone of the binding table
//!   or touch any RadioSession atomics directly.
