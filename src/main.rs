        // frame) looked right but a real test disproved it -- clicking

        // window managers/compositors throttle or skip repaints
        // entirely regardless of this app's own request_repaint_after
        // calls, so there may be NO intervening frame with
        // focused=false to compare against -- the first frame that
        // runs again can already show focused=true with `was_focused`
        // still stuck at whatever it was before the gap. On top of
        // that, the OS's WindowFocused event and the click's own
        // PointerButton event aren't guaranteed to land in the exact
        // same frame either. Fixed by combining two independent
        // signals -- the frame-to-frame transition (works whenever the
        // app IS still repainting through it) and a raw
        // Event::WindowFocused(true) appearing anywhere in this
        // frame's input queue (works even after a repaint gap, since
        // it's a discrete per-frame event log entry, not a state
        // comparison this project has to have observed changing).
        // unwrap_or(true) errors toward NOT suppressing when focus state
        // is unknown (some platforms/WMs don't always report it), since
        // a false positive here blocks a real click rather than just
        // failing to catch a spurious one.
        //
        // BUG FIX (round 3): this used to call ui.disable() on the whole
        // window for the real-time window below, which also blocked
        // ordinary controls (e.g. the TX row's TWO TONE button) that
        // happen to sit in this same root Ui -- a real report: with the
        // Settings window open and focused for PureSignal calibration,

        // refocus it and fire the button just silently refocused it

        // itself on a refocus click, not about buttons in general, so
        // this no longer disables anything globally -- `suppress_refocus_click`
        // is instead checked directly at the two click-to-tune sites
