/*
    TXA (WDSP's transmit chain) wrapper: takes mic/TX audio captured by
    audio.rs's MicInput, runs it through WDSP's TXA processing, and
    produces TX IQ samples at the radio's DUC rate for radio.rs's
    sender threads to stream out when MOX (PTT) is asserted.

    CONFIDENCE LEVEL, please read before trusting this blindly --
    this is the least-verified file in the whole project:

    - Every WDSP call for the RX/RXA side elsewhere in this codebase
      (spectrum.rs) was confirmed against a working reference
      implementation before being written. This file was NOT: there is
      no confirmed reference for the TXA call sequence, so everything
      here is inferred by symmetry with the confirmed RXA pattern (same
      OpenChannel/fexchange0 shape, mirrored: audio in instead of IQ
      in, IQ out instead of audio out) plus the WDSP header's own
      function names. That symmetry is a reasonable bet, not a
      confirmed fact.
    - In particular: whether fexchange0 is really the correct exchange
      function for a TXA (type_=1) channel -- as opposed to a separate,
      differently-named TX exchange function that isn't in this
      project's current wdsp_sys bindings -- is unconfirmed. If TX
      audio comes out silent, distorted, or fexchange0 errors out on a
      TXA channel, this is the first thing to check.
    - ALC is enabled with conservative fixed attack/decay/hang and
      WDSP's own internal default target level (there's no exposed
      Set*ALC target/top function in the current bindings, unlike
      RXA's AGC) -- not tuned or verified against real RF output.
    - FIXED, but noted in case it recurs in a different form: an
      earlier version used TX_CHANNEL=1000 (reasoning: "must be
      globally unique, distinct from any RX channel"), which segfaulted
      the whole process immediately on enabling TX -- almost certainly
      OpenChannel indexing "channel" directly into a small fixed-size
      C array with no bounds checking. RXA and TXA are separate
      internal tables (that's what OpenChannel's type_ param is for),
      so TX_CHANNEL only needs to be unique among other TXA channels,
      not globally; it's 0 now. If a segfault reappears immediately on
      enabling TX after some future change, a too-large or otherwise
      out-of-range id passed to any Set*() / Get*() call in this file is
      the first thing to suspect.

    DO NOT key this into an antenna without first verifying, into a
    dummy load at reduced drive, that: MOX actually gates transmission
    (never transmits unless explicitly armed), the audio isn't garbled,
    and ALC is actually preventing overdrive. See radio.rs for the
    equally-unverified protocol-level MOX/TX-IQ framing this feeds.

    PureSignal (Phase 2 -- see the plan doc for the full multi-phase
    story): feeds forward TX IQ and the two feedback streams radio.rs
    already demuxes into WDSP's calcc engine (feed_ps -> pscc), which lives
    inside this same TXA channel with no separate OpenChannel needed.
    Feedback arrives with real network latency behind the corresponding
    TX audio it's paired with here (see drain_ps_feedback) -- any
    chunk where it hasn't caught up yet simply skips the PS feed rather
    than stalling the real-time audio loop, which is expected/normal
    right after PTT, not an error. Forward TX IQ and RX-feedback are
    paired 1:1, both protocols -- see drain_ps_feedback's doc comment
    for a real bug this used to have here (an unnecessary 2:1 RX-
    feedback decimation, confirmed via real hardware A/B against
    piHPSDR to be actively suppressing Feedback Level). Like everything
    else in this file, none of this has a confirmed-working reference
    for the exact call cadence/timing -- Phase 4's real-hardware
    verification is what actually validates it.

// WDSP's C internals almost certainly index "channel" directly into a
// small fixed-size array with no bounds checking (typical for this
// style of embedded DSP library).
//
// Two hardcoded guesses here both crashed, for opposite reasons:
//   - channel=1000 ("must be globally unique") segfaulted immediately
//     on enabling TX -- almost certainly out-of-bounds on that array.
//   - channel=0 (assuming RXA and TXA are separate internal tables,
//     since that's what OpenChannel's type_ parameter suggests) also
//     segfaulted, but inside spectrum::run() -- the *RX* thread --
//     meaning it wasn't out-of-bounds, it collided with and corrupted
//     the already-running RXA channel 0's own state. So RXA and TXA
//     apparently do NOT have separate channel-number namespaces after
//     all, at least not for channel 0.
//
// Given two wrong guesses at a fixed constant, TxProcessor now takes
// its channel number as a parameter instead: the caller (main.rs)
// passes one derived from the actual number of RX channels open this
// session (RadioSession::iq_buffers.len()), which is structurally
// guaranteed distinct from every RX channel actually in use, and is
// always small (bounded by real receiver hardware, typically <=7) --
// as opposed to another arbitrary hardcoded number that might still
// collide with a future RX channel or exceed some still-unknown array
// bound. If this *still* segfaults, the channel-as-array-index theory
// itself may be wrong, or there's a different fixed bound (e.g. a
// MAX_CHANNELS-style constant) worth checking directly against your
// WDSP source if you have it.

// existed to have confirmed this. Confirmed wrong two ways: (1)
// piHPSDR's radio.c requests the IDENTICAL rate expression for both
// (`create_pure_signal_receiver(PS_TX_FEEDBACK, ..., 192000, ...)` and
// same for PS_RX_FEEDBACK); (2) this project's own radio.rs already
// requests both DDC0 and DDC1 at the same 192_000 (see
// p2_sender_loop's PureSignal DDC-rate comment) -- there was never a
// real 2x rate mismatch to correct for. The averaging was actively
// harmful: boxcar-averaging pairs of complex feedback samples smooths
// exactly the two-tone envelope peaks WDSP's calcc engine measures,
// suppressing the reported Feedback Level -- confirmed via real
// hardware A/B against piHPSDR on the same radio at the same drive
// (piHPSDR: Feedback Level 158 at 75W; hpsdr-rs before this fix: ~60
// at the same 75W). Removed entirely; both feedback streams are now
// paired 1:1, matching both confirmed references.
