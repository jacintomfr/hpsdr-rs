/*
    Audio input/output via cpal.

    AudioOutput reads demodulated audio produced by the spectrum/demod
    thread (spectrum.rs) out of a shared ring buffer and plays it
    through the system's default output device.

    MicInput is the TX-side counterpart: captures from the system's
    default input device (a physical mic for voice, or a virtual/
    loopback device fed by WSJT-X etc. for digital modes) and pushes
    downmixed-to-mono samples into a ring buffer that tx.rs's TXA
    thread reads from as the modulation source.

    NOTE: cpal's build_input_stream/build_output_stream signatures used
    here (config, data callback, error callback, timeout: Option
    <Duration>) match cpal 0.17's documented API, but this hasn't been
    compile-checked in this environment (no Rust toolchain available)
    -- same caveat as every other external-crate API surface in this
    project, so treat this as the next likely spot for a compiler-
    driven fix if cpal has moved since.

    Also: on Linux, building cpal requires the ALSA development headers
    (libasound2-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, alsa-lib-devel on Fedora) --
    even when PipeWire/PulseAudio/JACK are the actual runtime backend.

///
/// ROOT CAUSE FIX for a real report: initial testing sounded "OK" at
/// first, then some elements distorted, occasionally drifted out of
/// sync, and the tone kept sounding briefly after releasing the key.
///
/// Bug #1: `keyed` was gated on the radio's keying readback/
/// cw_mode_active/enabled alone, NOT on mox -- but spectrum.rs's real
/// RX-audio producer gates its own writes into this SAME queue purely
/// on mox being false. Since main.rs's break-in logic (which raises
/// mox) reads that same readback on its own ~16ms UI-frame cadence,
/// there was a real window on every key-down where this thread could
/// already be ramping up while spectrum.rs's thread was still pushing
/// live RX audio into the same queue -- two producers, unsynchronized,
/// landing in one FIFO. That's the distortion: audible RX content
/// time-interleaved with the sidetone. Fixed by also requiring `mox`
/// here, matching spectrum.rs's own gate exactly so the two producers
/// are mutually exclusive rather than merely usually so.
///
/// (A separate, later fix changed WHICH bit `cw_ptt_active` itself
/// reads -- see RadioSession::cw_ptt_active's own doc comment -- from
/// raw paddle-contact state to the radio's actual fully-timed keying
/// status. That fixed a different symptom, individual elements not
/// being audible during Iambic sending, but is the same underlying
/// signal referred to here.)
///
/// Bug #2: any stale backlog already sitting in the queue when a key
/// transition happens (leftover RX audio from just before mox went up,
/// or this generator's own prior-element backlog) plays out BEFORE the
/// freshly generated samples for the new state, since it's a FIFO --
/// audible as sync drifting worse over a longer transmission, and as
/// the tone continuing to sound for a bit after key-up (the queue was
/// still draining old, already-generated at-full-volume samples).
/// Fixed by flushing the queue outright on EVERY key transition (both
/// directions), so only what's generated AFTER a transition (the fresh
/// tone, or the fresh ramp-down) is ever queued following it.
///
/// A second attempt at bug #2 tried enforcing a tight (10ms) target
/// latency on EVERY tick instead of only at transitions -- that was
/// itself a bug: it fought the audio backend's own normal output
/// buffering (commonly tens of ms, decided by cpal/the OS, not
/// something this code controls), repeatedly ripping out samples mid-
/// waveform that simply hadn't been played yet. A real report: EVERY
/// element sounded distorted afterward, not just some -- consistent
/// with near-constant chopping rather than an occasional real desync.
/// Reverted to a purely transition-triggered flush plus a generous
/// passive overflow backstop (CW_SIDETONE_BUFFER_CAPACITY, matching
/// spectrum.rs's own AUDIO_BUFFER_CAPACITY) that only ever fires on a
/// genuine pathological stall, never during ordinary playback.
///
/// Iambic A/B: `keyed` comes from IambicSimulator instead of
/// cw_ptt_active directly -- see that struct's own doc comment for
/// why (cw_ptt_active can't distinguish individual elements during a
/// held squeeze). Straight key still uses cw_ptt_active directly
/// (unaffected, already correct, and simpler/more trustworthy than
/// running it through the simulator's own Straight-key handling, which
/// isn't implemented here at all -- see IambicSimulator's own doc
/// comment on what's deliberately narrower than the reference).
