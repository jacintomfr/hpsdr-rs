// Adapted from SDRoxide (https://github.com/madmedicnl/sdroxide,
// crates/sdroxide-rade/src/worker.rs, upstream commit 63b0b29), licensed
// GPL-3.0-or-later. Combined here under the hpsdr-rs project, whose own
// GPL-2.0-or-later license permits combination with GPL-3.0 code (the
// combined work is GPL-3.0).
//
// Local changes from upstream: `use sdroxide_dsp::MonoResampler` ->
// `use super::resample::MonoResampler` (this project vendors only that one
// resampler -- see resample.rs's own doc comment), `use crate::{...}` ->
// `use super::{...}` (this is a submodule of `crate::rade`, not the crate
// root), and `tracing::{info, warn}` -> plain `eprintln!`, matching this
// project's own existing logging convention (no `tracing` dependency
// elsewhere in hpsdr-rs). The modem/threading logic itself is unchanged.

//! [`RadeWorker`] -- RADE driven on its own thread, with lock-free rings at
//! the edges.
//!
//! Acquisition, demodulation and neural decode all happen here, on one
//! thread, because the inference cost is small but variable and must not
//! land on the engine's sample-rate loop. Audio crosses in and out through
//! `rtrb` rings at the caller's rate; every sample-rate conversion lives
//! inside the worker so there is exactly one place where the clock domains
//! meet.
//!
//! Shape follows SDRoxide's own `SkimmerController`: bounded rings for
//! realtime data (dropped under backpressure, counted), an unbounded
//! channel for control (never dropped).
