//! The `HRA_56_56` parity-check matrix for the LDPC(112,56) code used by the
//! RADE V1 End-of-Over text channel.
//!
//! `H = [H_a | H_b]` is 56x112.
//!
//! * `H_a` (the systematic half) is a regular matrix: every row *and* every
//!   column has weight 3, 168 ones in all. Storing three column indices per row
//!   costs 168 bytes against 6272 for the dense form.
//! * `H_b` (the parity half) is exactly identity + subdiagonal, so it is
//!   generated rather than stored -- which is also what makes the encoder a
//!   forward substitution rather than a matrix inversion.
//!
//! Transcribed from `HRA_56_56.h` / `HRA_56_56.txt` in
//! <https://github.com/tmiw/freedv-backend> (BSD-2-Clause); the matrix itself
//! originates with David Rowe's codec2 work and has been frozen since 2017.
//! The invariants above are re-checked by the tests below, so a transcription
//! slip cannot pass silently.

/// Column indices of the three ones in each row of `H_a`, ascending.
///
/// Ascending order matters: the decoder sums float messages in edge order, so
/// reproducing the reference's row-major edge enumeration is what keeps our
/// arithmetic bit-comparable with it.
