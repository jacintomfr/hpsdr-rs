 * Adapted from SDRoxide (https://github.com/madmedicnl/sdroxide,
 * crates/sdroxide-rade/src/shim.h, upstream commit 63b0b29), licensed
 * GPL-3.0-or-later. Combined here under the hpsdr-rs project, whose own
 * GPL-2.0-or-later license permits combination with GPL-3.0 code (the
 * combined work is GPL-3.0). Unchanged from upstream apart from the
 * SDROXIDE_ -> HPSDR_RS_ include-guard rename.
 *
 * hpsdr-rs's own rade.rs doc comment has the full story of what this shim
 * is for and why it exists (a stable C surface over Opus's FARGAN/LPCNet
 * vocoder, since RADE's own API stops at feature vectors).
 *
 * hpsdr_rs_rade shim: a stable, minimal C surface over Opus's FARGAN/LPCNet
 * vocoder.
 *
 * RADE's own API (rade_api.h) starts and ends at FARGAN feature vectors:
 * rade_tx() consumes them, rade_rx() produces them. Turning 16 kHz speech into
 * features and back is the caller's job, and needs Opus internals (`lpcnet.h`,
 * `fargan.h`) that are not meant to be consumed from outside the Opus build.
 * Rather than binding those headers, this shim exposes the four operations we
 * actually need behind opaque handles.
 *
 * Frame geometry (fixed by Opus): one call is LPCNET_FRAME_SIZE = 160 samples
 * = 10 ms at 16 kHz, producing NB_TOTAL_FEATURES = 36 floats. RADE V1 packs 12
 * such frames into each 120 ms modem frame.
