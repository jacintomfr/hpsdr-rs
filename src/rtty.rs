// RTTY (Baudot/ITA2 FSK) modem, adapted from SDRoxide
// (https://github.com/madmedicnl/sdroxide, crates/sdroxide-dsp/src/rtty.rs
// and crates/sdroxide-dsp/src/fir.rs, upstream commit 63b0b29),
// licensed GPL-3.0-or-later. Combined here under the hpsdr-rs project,
// whose own GPL-2.0-or-later license permits combination with GPL-3.0 code
// (the combined work is GPL-3.0).
//
// Local changes from upstream: the `fir` helpers this modem needs
// (`lowpass_taps`, `bandpass_taps`, `ComplexFir`) are folded into the
// private `fir` submodule at the bottom of this file, with SDRoxide's
// SIMD-dispatch kernel replaced by its plain scalar body, and the unused
// `RealFir` / group-delay helpers dropped. `Complex32` is a local alias.
// The modem logic itself is unchanged.

//! RTTY modem: streaming decode + encode of Baudot (ITA2) FSK.
//!
//! Standard amateur RTTY: 45.45 baud, 170 Hz shift, 5-bit Baudot with
//! LTRS/FIGS shift, 1 start bit (space) + 5 data (LSB first) + 1.5 stop (mark),
//! idle = mark. USB-side: mark is the higher tone (`center + shift/2`), space
//! the lower. Baud, shift and mark/space sense are configurable.
//!
//! RX down-converts to complex baseband at the operator's center tone and runs
//! the textbook non-coherent FSK detector: one integrate-and-dump matched
//! filter per tone, sliced on the difference of their envelopes. A bit clock
//! locked to the observed transitions strobes at each bit centre, and a UART
//! framer that *validates* the start and stop bits assembles characters. TX
//! renders phase-continuous FSK.
//!
//! Four details are what make this read a real signal rather than a loopback
//! (issue #23):
//!
//! * The matched filters, not an FM discriminator, make the bit decision. A
//!   moving average of one bit has an equivalent noise bandwidth of exactly the
//!   baud rate, so it collects the full matched-filter processing gain — worth
//!   about 6 dB against slicing the instantaneous frequency sample by sample.
//! * Framing is checked, not assumed, and output is gated on it. The old slicer
//!   resynchronised on any mark→space edge and emitted whatever five bits
//!   followed, so noise during the 1.5-bit stop period manufactured a character
//!   every time — a receiver sitting on an empty channel produced several
//!   characters a second of hash. Requiring a space start bit and a mark stop
//!   bit, and holding output until a few frames in a row have validated,
//!   silences that without costing any sensitivity.
//! * Automatic threshold correction refers each tone to its own recent level.
//!   HF paths are frequency selective, so mark and space regularly arrive tens
//!   of dB apart; comparing raw envelopes then decides on the fade instead of
//!   on the data.
//! * AFC tracks tuning error, which the matched filters are far less forgiving
//!   of than the old wideband discriminator was — and which is exactly what the
//!   reporter had to switch on in FLdigi to read the same signal.
