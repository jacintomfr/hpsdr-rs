/*
    Minimal implementation of the TCI (Transceiver Control Interface)
    protocol -- an open WebSocket-based control protocol originally from
    Expert Electronics (ExpertSDR2/3), also supported by Thetis/
    OpenHPSDR and digital-mode software like JTDX. Listens on
    0.0.0.0:50001 by default (Thetis's own default TCI port, and what
    real-world TCI Remote/TCI Remote Compactor setups were confirmed
    using via packet capture during this project's own interop
    debugging -- an earlier default of 40001 here, cited as "TCI's
    standard default port", didn't match that in practice; bound to
    all interfaces rather than just loopback) so a client on another
    machine on the network -- a remote-operating laptop, a tablet, a
    separate shack PC -- can connect too, not just software running on
    this same machine. This protocol has no authentication of its own,
    so anyone who can reach this port on the network can control the
    radio; only expose it on networks you trust.

    CONFIDENCE LEVEL, please read before trusting this blindly:
    - Command syntax (`name:arg1,arg2,...;`, reserved chars :,;) and the
      default port are confirmed from the official protocol README
      (github.com/ExpertSDR3/TCI), and since then directly against
      Expert Electronics' own "TCI Protocol Ver. 2.0" PDF (12 Jan 2024)
      -- the authoritative spec, not a third-party reconstruction.
    - The specific commands implemented here (vfo, modulation, trx,
      audio_start/stop, iq_start/stop, rit_offset, rit_enable,
      xit_offset, xit_enable) and their argument order are confirmed
      against BOTH that spec and JTDX's actual working TCI client
      implementation (TCITransceiver.cpp) -- except rit/xit, whose
      argument order (receiver,value/bool) is inferred from this
      project's own already-existing initial-state push for these same
      commands (see handle_client), not independently re-verified.
      rx_nb_enable/rx_nr_enable's plain (non-_ex) form and argument
      order (receiver,bool) are confirmed against a real captured
      Thetis<->SunSDR2PRO session (TCIServer.cs's reference dump);
      rx_nb2_enable and the _ex variants (which add a 1-indexed `stage`
      argument selecting which NB/NR stage) are confirmed against a
      real TCI Remote session log (tci_log.txt) exercising all of
      NB/NB2/NR/NR2/NR3/NR4 -- see rx_nb_enable_ex/rx_nr_enable_ex's own
      doc comments for the real bug this caught (stage was originally
      assumed 0-indexed and, for NR, ignored outright). rx_anf_enable/
      rx_bin_enable follow the exact same bare-query-or-set pattern
      (base command syntax already confirmed for rx_*_enable in
      general) but, unlike NB/NR, have NOT yet been exercised against a
      real client's own ANF/BIN buttons specifically -- flag any report
      of unexpected behavior from those two the same way NB/NR's own
      _ex indexing bug was found, rather than assuming this pattern
      definitely holds for them too.
    - The *initial handshake sequence* sent on connect now includes
      every Initialization command the spec defines (section 4.1):
      protocol, device, vfo_limits, trx_count, channels_count,
      receive_only, modulations_list, plus vfo/modulation/trx state and
      start;/ready; (semicolon-terminated, start before ready -- CONFIRMED
      against a real packet capture of actual Thetis wire traffic, see
      handle_client's own doc comment at the send site for the full story
      of why a written protocol reference claiming otherwise turned out
      to be wrong here), and if_limits (a fixed -96000..96000 Hz range --
      no real IF-shift-within-panorama concept implemented here to report
      an exact one for, but a static "wide enough" range is harmless and
      this field is documented as accepted-and-discarded by TCI Remote
      regardless).
    - TCI mode-string spellings (LSB/USB/CW/etc.) match the spec's own
      MODULATIONS_LIST example and are cross-checked against JTDX/
      WSJT-X source for exact case-sensitivity behavior (see
      mode_to_tci's doc comment).
    - trx's optional 3rd argument (signal source: tci/mic1/mic2/micPC/
      ecoder2, spec section 4.2) is now parsed -- see tci_wants_mic's
      doc comment in radio.rs for what it does and, importantly, what
      it deliberately does NOT do (flip Auto's default when arg3 is
      absent, which would break TCI Remote's confirmed-working TX audio
      path -- that client never sends arg3 at all).
    - tungstenite's exact API surface (accept(), get_ref(), etc.) is
      from general knowledge of the crate, not verified against 0.29
      specifically -- same caveat as every other external-crate API in
      this project.
    - The binary streaming format (audio_start/audio_stop/iq_start/
      iq_stop, and the 64-byte header + LE f32 samples it triggers) is
      confirmed against rustyHPSDR's own TCI server
      (~/github/rustyHPSDR/src/tci/mod.rs) -- the strongest reference
      available here, since the user has it directly confirmed
      working against TCI Remote, the exact client this was written
      for. An earlier pass was based on github.com/ftl/tci (a clean
      independent Go client library) instead, which got several
      concrete details wrong once cross-checked against rustyHPSDR:
      Format=4 instead of the correct 3, no explicit `channels` field
      (rustyHPSDR always declares stereo, channels=2, as its own
      header field rather than folding it into reserved padding),
      9 reserved u32s instead of 8, `length` as total float count
      instead of frame-pair count, and I/Q samples in the naive I-then-Q
      order rather than rustyHPSDR's explicitly-swapped Q-then-I.
      rustyHPSDR also streams audio to any connected client
      unconditionally (no audio_start/audio_stop gate at all, only
      iq_start/iq_stop) -- matched here too (audio_streaming defaults
      to true), while still honoring audio_start/audio_stop if a
      client sends them, for compatibility with clients that expect
      that gate to exist. Thetis's own TCI server
      (TAPR/OpenHPSDR-Thetis/.../TCIServer.cs) turned out to have this
      as a literal `// todo !` stub, so wasn't usable as a reference at
      all.

    trx (PTT) flips RadioSession's mox flag -- same one the on-screen
    PTT button and rigctl's set_ptt use. See rigctl.rs's module note on
    the "armed but keyed with silence" gap if TX isn't enabled in
    Settings -> TX when a client sends trx:0,true;.

    Unlike rigctl.rs: TCI also streams RX audio (audio_start/stop) and
    raw wideband IQ (iq_start/stop, which is what lets a client render
    its own spectrum/waterfall -- TCI has no separate spectrum message
    type) to clients, as TCI Remote (an Android remote-listening app)
    needs both to be useful for anything beyond frequency/mode/PTT
    sync. See spectrum.rs's tci_audio_out/iq_out doc comments for
    where this data actually comes from -- dedicated taps, not shared
    with the existing local-playback/analyzer consumers of similar
    data, since a second reader of an already-consumed queue would
    steal samples from the first.

    TX audio (a client sending audio to the radio, e.g. for voice
    macros or a fully remote digital-mode setup) is implemented and
    confirmed working end-to-end against TCI Remote: PTT, TxChrono
    requests, and the TX_AUDIO_STREAM response are all exchanged
    correctly, and the received audio reaches WDSP's TXA chain at a
    proper level (verified via its own internal meters against a Tune
    baseline). One real-world quirk found along the way: TCI Remote's
    `length` header field does NOT follow the frame-pair convention
    this project's own outgoing messages use (see
    decode_binary_message's doc comment) -- incoming payload size is
    derived from the actual received byte count instead of trusting
    that field. Received TX audio lands in radio.rs's
    RadioSession::tci_tx_audio, which tx.rs's TXA loop prefers over the
    local mic_buffer on any chunk where it has data (see run()'s doc
    comment there) -- so local mic PTT keeps working completely
    unaffected whenever no TCI client is actively sending audio.

/// replies with real silence, not corruption (which the existing
/// per-pair sanity check already handles separately). The likely cause:
/// at 512 samples/request, this project's own real-time consumption
/// (tx.rs draining TX_BUFFER_SIZE every ~10.7ms) forces a fresh
/// TxChrono roughly every ~10.7ms -- apparently faster than WSJT-X's
/// own internal Tune-audio generation can keep up with, so most
/// requests arrive before it has anything new and get silence-padded
/// (spec explicitly permits this: "may send a signal with zero counts,
/// which corresponds to no signal"). At 2048, each reply covers
/// ~42.7ms, so a fresh request is only needed about a quarter as often
/// -- much closer to Thetis's own proven-working cadence (its default
/// AUDIO_STREAM_SAMPLES, confirmed via a real captured working
/// session). The earlier "periodic pulsing" seen at 2048 was recorded
/// before that silence diagnostic existed to check WHY -- never actually
/// confirmed to be worse than 512's own pulsing, just assumed so from

            // backlog-accumulation mechanism the oversized-frame bug
            // above came from: the broadcaster fills this sink from the
            // moment the client connects, regardless of iq_streaming,
            // so by the time a client finishes its setup handshake and
            // finally sends iq_start, the sink can already hold a
            // second or more of stale IQ data queued up while nobody
            // was listening. Chunking (above) fixed the disconnect that
            // backlog caused, but still played the whole stale backlog
            // back-to-back once chunked -- a client's spectrum/
            // waterfall has no way to know that burst isn't real-time,
            // so it renders wrong until real-time data catches up.

            // (part of Compactor's own normal connect sequence, not
            // just the error-retry case this file already documents
            // elsewhere). Clearing unconditionally on a repeat send

// BUG FIX: these were uppercase ("USB" etc). Confirmed via WSJT-X's own
// TCITransceiver.cpp (Transceiver/TCITransceiver.cpp, Cmd_Mode handler):
// it only lowercases an incoming modulation value when `device:` was
// exactly "Thetis" or "ExpertSDR3" (an internal ESDR3/HPSDR flag pair
// set from the Cmd_Version handler) -- any other device string (this
// project sends "hpsdr-rs") takes the plain `mode_ = args.at(1);`
// branch, no case-folding. Meanwhile WSJT-X's own OUTGOING/desired mode
// (`map_mode()`) is unconditionally lowercase ("usb" etc). If this
// project's own CONNECT-TIME handshake sent uppercase, WSJT-X's
// internal `mode_` would end up uppercase while its `requested_mode_`
// stays lowercase -- guaranteeing a mismatch the moment Tune/TX starts,
// which triggers WSJT-X's own confirmed race-prone blocking mode-set
// exchange (do_frequency, TCITransceiver.cpp ~line 1155) and a real
// chance of "TCI failed set mode". Sending lowercase everywhere (this
// project's own handshake, heartbeat, and command replies) means
// WSJT-X's `mode_` already matches `requested_mode_` before Tune is
// ever pressed, avoiding that exchange entirely rather than trying to
// win its race.
