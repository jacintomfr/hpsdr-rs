/*
    Protocol 1 (Metis/old protocol) and Protocol 2 start-and-stream
    implementation.

    RX frame layout and register encoding confirmed against the user's
    own old_protocol.c / new_protocol.c and the official openHPSDR
    Ethernet Protocol v4.3 spec, rather than reconstructed from public
    docs alone -- see inline notes for the handful of RX pieces that
    are still educated assumptions rather than verified.

    TX (MOX/PTT + TX audio/IQ streaming) is NOT held to that same bar.
    None of it has a confirmed reference -- see the module notes on
    fill_tx_payload (P1) and the "Protocol 2 TX (DUC) IQ streaming"
    section (P2) below for exactly what's guessed and how each guess
    is designed to fail closed (no transmission) rather than fail open
    (unintended transmission) if wrong. Bench-test into a dummy load
    at reduced drive before ever keying into an antenna.

///   real receivers are offset to start at DDC2, but unlike P1 the cap
///   isn't a fixed board constant (P2's DDC count varies by board), so

///   all: `settings.receivers` (from the board's discovery reply) was
///   used unreduced for both `iq_buffers` sizing and the "Add
///   Receiver" UI cap, while p2_sender_loop separately ADDS 2 reserved
///   DDCs on top whenever PS is active. A user could "Add Receiver" up

    // though only 2 are ever actually streamed for diversity), NOT the
    // count the ongoing stream actually uses. Confirmed via a real
    // packet capture: preconfig's C4 byte declared "7 receivers, RX
    // sync bit set" while the ongoing stream immediately afterward
    // declared "2 receivers, RX sync bit set" -- baseline (non-
    // diversity) has an analogous 7-vs-1 mismatch that's harmless, but
    // COMBINED with the sync bit (which asks the radio to pair up its
    // DDCs), a declared-7-then-actually-2 transition very plausibly
    // leaves the FPGA's internal dual-DDC pairing setup inconsistent --
    // a real candidate for the radio going silent about a second into
    // 2-receiver diversity streaming regardless of sample rate. Now
    // matches `active_receiver_count`'s own initial value, so preconfig
    // and the ongoing stream agree on the receiver count from the very
    // first packet, not just the sync bit.

/// time was measured per-FRAME instead of per-PACKET, discarding

/// second real regression report (ANAN-100D) immediately after (3)
/// shipped. Fixing that accounting bug alone wasn't enough either -- a
/// THIRD real report, after the accounting fix, described the
/// remaining noise as "raspy, changes when someone is talking": that's
/// the textbook signature of a zero-order-hold reconstruction (more
/// audible exactly when the signal has more dynamic/high-frequency
/// content, i.e. active speech), which step (1) above already showed

        // board-specific cause). Confirmed via the ORIGINAL piHPSDR/
        // deskHPSDR author (this project's P1 wire format is ported
        // from their code): the real reference implementation has NO
        // explicit send-interval timer at all. WDSP's OpenChannel fixes
        // audio output at 48000 regardless of ADC rate; fexchange0
        // produces audio at that fixed rate; those bytes accumulate
        // into a fixed-size output buffer, and a packet is sent only
        // when that buffer fills -- a purely event-driven design whose
        // EMERGENT packet rate is always ~48000/126 ~= 381/sec,
        // independent of ADC rate. Audio sent to the radio is single-
        // active-receiver only (no mixing), so receiver count was never
        // a factor in that timing either.
        //
        // This function instead computed an explicit interval scaled by
        // BOTH current_rate and receivers (see git history for the
        // removed samples_per_frame/samples_per_packet computation) --
        // a design that was never part of the original architecture. A
        // real Wireshark capture confirmed this pushed the packet rate
        // to ~6400/sec (156us apart) with PureSignal's reserved
        // receivers=5 at 192kHz -- 16x the original design's natural
        // cadence. A careful two-pass reconstruction of the actual wire
        // bytes from that capture, resampled onto a true 48kHz grid and
        // confirmed clean by ear, ruled out RxAudioPacer's content/
        // sample-selection logic -- the remaining difference was purely
        // this cadence.

        // KNOWN RISK: an earlier "ROOT CAUSE FIX" (now removed, see git

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Protocol 2
//
// Unlike Protocol 1's single shared port, P2 uses four fixed destination
// ports on the radio (General/DDC-specific/TX-specific/High-priority),
// and the radio streams data back to whatever address+port the host
// used to make contact -- so one unconnected local socket handles
// everything, with incoming packets demultiplexed by source port.
//
// "Start" is not a dedicated command: setup packets are sent once
// (General, DDC-specific, TX-specific), then a High Priority packet
// with the run bit set actually starts streaming. All four are then
// resent together on the keep-alive timer, since the radio drops back
// to standby if it doesn't see a C&C packet within ~1 second.
