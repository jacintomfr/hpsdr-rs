/*
    USB I/O + digital down-conversion for the RX-888 Mk2 -- a receive-
    only, Cypress FX3-based direct-sampling HF SDR (LTC2208-class ADC,
    no on-board DDC/tuner in the mode this module uses). Unlike every
    other board this project talks to (openHPSDR Protocol 1/2 over UDP,
    or Ozy's own P1-over-USB -- see ozy.rs), the RX-888 has no framing
    and no complex IQ at all: it streams the ENTIRE captured Nyquist
    band as raw signed 16-bit real ADC samples over a USB3 bulk
    endpoint, with no on-board mixer/decimator. This module is what
    turns that firehose into the same `IqSample` stream every other
    board already feeds into `RadioSession::iq_buffers` -- an NCO
    (numerically controlled oscillator) mixer to shift the wanted RF
    frequency to baseband, followed by a CIC decimator to bring the
    rate down to something WDSP can consume (WDSP does its own further
    decimation from there down to 48kHz, exactly as it already does for
    every other board -- see radio.rs's start_rx888_usb doc comment).

    USB protocol constants and the firmware bring-up sequence below are
    ported from the user's own local reference checkout
    (~/github/ka9q-radio/rx888.c, rx888.h, ezusb.c -- a real, working
    Linux driver for this exact device), not guessed or reconstructed
    from general Cypress FX3 documentation:
    - VID/PID and the two-phase "find unloaded -> load firmware -> find
      loaded" bring-up: rx888.c's rx888_usb_init.
    - The FX3 RAM-image (.img) format `load_fx3_image` below parses:
      ezusb.c's fx3_load_ram (itself citing Cypress AN76405/"docID
      41351"). NOT the same format as Ozy's Intel-HEX .hex file (see
      ozy.rs's load_firmware) -- FX3 uses its own binary record format
      with a running checksum, ported byte-for-byte.
    - Vendor control-transfer conventions (`command_send`/
      `argument_send` below): ezusb.c lines 847-884, confirmed exact
      (bRequest/wValue/wIndex/payload split for each).
    - Streaming/gain/dither bring-up order (`initialise` below):
      rx888.c's rx888_set_samprate / rx888_set_dither_and_randomizer /
      rx888_set_att / rx888_start_rx, in that same order. Dither and the
      output randomizer default OFF, matching ka9q-radio's own
      `config_getboolean(..., "dither"/"rand", false)` default -- NOT
      "on by default" as this feature's own early planning notes
      assumed before this file was written against the real source.
    - Si5351 clock-generator register math is intentionally NOT ported
      here: rx888_set_samprate only falls through to manual Si5351 PLL
      programming for a non-default reference clock or a calibration
      offset. For the default 27MHz reference (this module's only
      supported case for now -- see DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE_HZ), it just
      sends STARTADC with the desired rate and the FX3 firmware itself
      programs the Si5351 -- a real simplification confirmed by reading
      that function, not an omission.

    UNTESTED end-to-end: this development environment has no USB
    access at all. Every constant/sequence below is ported from
    ka9q-radio's working source, but the USB transport plumbing itself
    has only ever been `cargo build`'d, never run against a real
    RX-888. The NCO/CIC math is standard, well-understood DSP (not
    protocol-guesswork), but its exact gain scaling and tuning-offset
    convention are flagged in the feature's own plan as the two things
    most likely to need real-hardware iteration.
