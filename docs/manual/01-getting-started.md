# Getting Started

## Installing and running

See the [top-level README](../../README.md#building) for build requirements
and instructions. Once built:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Discovering your radio

On launch, the **Discover HPSDR Radios** window opens automatically and
immediately starts discovering radios on all the network interfaces (standard
openHPSDR UDP discovery broadcast, port 1024).

![Discovery window](images/01-discovery-window.png)

> **Radio plugged straight into the computer (no router)?** The computer's interface needs a `169.254.x.x` address or nothing will be listed -- see [Connecting a radio directly to the computer](21-direct-connection.md).

The window lists every radio that responded, one row per device, with
columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Device | Board type (e.g. `Orion2`, `Hermes`, `HermesLite2`) |
| Interface | The local network interface the reply was heard on -- name and IP address (e.g. `eth0 (192.168.1.50)`), or just the IP if the interface's name isn't known (a manually-entered IP, see below) |
| IP | The radio's own IP address |
| MAC | The radio's MAC address (also used as the key for its saved settings) |
| Protocol | 1 (Metis/Ozy-style) or 2 (Hermes/Orion-style) |
| Version | Firmware version |
| Status | **Available** or **In Use** |

Click anywhere on a row to select it -- the whole row highlights. Only
**Available** radios can be selected and started; a radio already **In Use**
(by another client, or another instance of this app) is shown but disabled.
Double-clicking an **Available** row starts it immediately, same as
selecting it and pressing **Start**.

The first **Available** radio in the list is selected automatically as
soon as results land (skipping over any radio already **In Use**), so you
can usually just click **Start** -- or double-click that row.

**Rediscover** clears the current list and scans again -- useful if your
radio was slow to respond or you just powered it on.

**Manual IP** lets you connect directly to a known IP address instead of
waiting for a broadcast reply to arrive, which is useful if your radio is on
a different subnet than broadcast discovery can reach (e.g. across a router
that doesn't forward broadcasts). Type the address into the field and click
**Add**; if a radio responds there, it's added to the list the same as a
broadcast-discovered one.

**Firmware Update...** opens a separate window for updating a radio's FPGA
firmware or changing its IP address while it's in bootloader mode -- see
[Firmware Update](09-firmware-update.md).

**Ozy USB setup** is for the original HPSDR hardware (an Ozy board with
separate Mercury/Penny boards), which connects over USB instead of the
network and needs a one-time driver/firmware setup before it shows up in
this list -- see [Ozy USB](19-ozy-usb.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Connecting

With a radio selected, click **Start**. The app connects, opens the main
window, and restores that radio's last-used settings (frequency, mode,
filter width, calibration, etc.) automatically -- each physical radio (by
MAC address) keeps its own independent saved configuration, so switching
between radios doesn't mix up their settings.

To disconnect, use the **Stop** button at the bottom of the main window.
This returns you to the discovery window.
