# Extra Receivers

hpsdr-rs supports multiple simultaneous, independent receivers on radios
that report supporting more than one (Protocol 2 boards, generally, plus
an [RX-888 Mk2](20-rx888-mk2.md) -- up to 8, each an independent software
DDC over the same wideband capture, running in parallel on its own CPU
core). Each extra receiver gets its own window with its own VFO, mode,
filter width, spectrum/waterfall, and settings -- entirely separate from
the main receiver and from each other.

## Adding a receiver

Click **Add Receiver (n/max)**, below the S-meter on the main window. A new
window titled **Receiver N** opens. This button disappears (replaced by
**All N receivers active**) once you've reached the radio's maximum
receiver count.

On a [PureSignal](14-puresignal.md)-capable radio, "max" here is 2 lower
than the radio's full receiver capacity -- PureSignal's two feedback
receivers are reserved for the whole session as soon as you connect,
whether or not PureSignal is actually enabled.

## Using an extra receiver window

It behaves like a scaled-down version of the main window: VFO-A/VFO-B
boxes with **A>B**/**B>A**/**A<>B** buttons (same as the main window's own
-- see [Frequency display and tuning](02-main-window.md#frequency-display-and-tuning)
-- but no **Split** button, since extra receivers never transmit), with
**CTUN** and, while in CW mode, **CW Decode** (see
[CW decoder](02-main-window.md#cw-decode)) in the row underneath, band
and mode rows, **Filter width** and **Audio gain** sliders, the
**Record**/NB/NR/SNB/ANF/BIN/AGC/AGC Gain/RIT toggle row -- RIT here
works the same as the
main window's own (see [Transmit controls](02-main-window.md#transmit-controls)),
just always visible rather than tucked into a TX-only row, since it's a
receive-only feature and this window has no XIT (extra receivers never
transmit) -- its own spectrum and waterfall panes with their own
[Zoom/Pan sliders](02-main-window.md#zoom-and-pan) below
the waterfall (click or scroll to tune, same conventions as the main
window, though Ctrl+scroll's 10kHz-step tuning gesture isn't available
here), and its own S-meter with a **Settings...** button.

**Record** here works exactly like the main window's own [Record
button](02-main-window.md#record) -- its own independent recording of
this receiver's RX audio, landing in the same `recordings` folder,
distinguished from the main receiver's (and any other extra receiver's)
by a `rxN` suffix on the filename (e.g. `hpsdr-rs_<timestamp>_rx1.wav`)
so simultaneous recordings from different receivers never collide.

## Extra receiver Settings

Each extra receiver's **Settings...** opens its own settings window with
three tabs -- **RX**, **Spectrum**, **EQ** -- a subset of the main window's
tabs, since things like Network, Audio (main output only), TX, PA
Calibration, PureSignal, and Diversity are session-wide, not per-receiver:

- **RX** -- sample rate (Protocol 1 boards, and an RX-888, follow the main
  receiver's rate -- see [Settings: RX](15-settings-rx.md#sample-rate)),
  ADC/antenna selection, the same AGC attack/decay/hang/top/slope and
  [S-Meter Cal](15-settings-rx.md#s-meter-cal) and NB threshold controls
  as the main window's RX tab, and its own independent **Output device**
  picker (same device list and fallback behavior as the main window's
  [Audio tab](05-settings-audio.md)) -- so this receiver can play to a
  different device than the main receiver.
- **Spectrum** -- display range and waterfall palette, same as the main
  window's Spectrum tab (no separate TX range here, since extra receivers
  never transmit).
- **EQ** -- its own independent [graphic equalizer](08-equalizer.md),
  RX-only.

Every extra receiver's settings persist per radio, the same as the main
window's.
