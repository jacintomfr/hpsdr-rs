# Main Window

![Main window overview](images/02-main-window-overview.png)

## Frequency display and tuning

The large number near the top, in its own **VFO-A** box, is the current
main VFO frequency (comma-grouped, in Hz) -- green normally, red while
that VFO is the one actually transmitting (see
[Split](#vfo-a--vfo-b--split) below). You can tune it several ways:

- **Scroll** while hovering the frequency display, or the spectrum/waterfall
  panes: steps by 1 kHz per notch. Hold **Shift** while scrolling for 100 Hz
  steps. In CW mode (**CWL**/**CWU**), steps are finer -- 100 Hz per notch,
  10 Hz with Shift -- matching how tightly CW is normally zero-beaten.
  Clicking a signal on the spectrum/waterfall in CW mode also centers it in
  the (narrow) CW filter passband rather than at the dial frequency itself,
  using the *exact* frequency under the cursor rather than rounding to the
  nearest kHz the way every other mode's click does -- a CW signal is
  essentially never sitting exactly on a kHz boundary -- see [CW
  Decode](#cw-decode) below.
- **Ctrl + scroll** (or a pinch/zoom gesture) over the spectrum: steps by
  10 kHz per notch normally, or 1 Hz per notch in CW mode -- egui reports
  this as a distinct "zoom" gesture rather than an ordinary scroll, which
  is why it has its own, coarser-by-default step instead of just adding a
  third tier to the plain-scroll steps above.
- **Click** directly on the spectrum or waterfall: retunes straight to the
  clicked frequency -- rounded to the nearest kHz in every mode except CW,
  which uses the exact clicked frequency (see above).
- **Right-click** the frequency display (VFO-A or VFO-B): opens a small
  popup with an on-screen numeric keypad (plus normal keyboard digit/
  Backspace/Enter/Escape input) to type an exact frequency directly,
  rather than scrolling or clicking a spot on the spectrum. Retunes as
  soon as you press **Enter**, clamped to the radio's own tunable range.
- **Click and drag** across the spectrum or waterfall: retunes by however
  far you've dragged, in whichever direction, rather than jumping straight
  to wherever the cursor ends up. With [CTUN](#ctun-click-to-tune) off,
  this grabs and moves the display itself (drag right to bring lower
  frequencies into view, left for higher). With CTUN on, the spectrum
  itself doesn't move (the radio's real tuned frequency stays fixed) --
  instead this drags the CTUN listen point directly, the same direction as
  your cursor, the same way clicking a spot tunes straight to it.

![Screenshot needed: the right-click frequency-entry keypad popup](images/02-frequency-entry.png)

### CTUN (Click to Tune)

The **CTUN** button (in its own row in the **VFO-A** box, below **A<>B**/
**Split**) toggles an alternate tuning mode: instead of retuning
the radio's actual hardware oscillator on every click/scroll, the *listen
point* moves within the currently-received passband, and the radio's real
tuned frequency stays fixed. This is useful for quickly browsing around a
band without the radio re-locking/re-settling each time. The CTUN dial is
clamped so the current mode's filter passband always stays fully within the
visible spectrum span.

While CTUN is on, VFO B's **B>A** and **A<>B** buttons (below) move the
CTUN listen point the same clamped way, rather than retuning the radio's
actual hardware oscillator.

### CW Decode

The **CW Decode** button (next to **CTUN**, only shown while actually in
**CWL**/**CWU**) turns a built-in, single-signal CW (Morse) decoder on or
off -- whatever signal is actually tuned in and audible, not a
multi-signal "skimmer". Turning it off both hides its panel beside the
spectrum/waterfall and stops it decoding, so turning it back on starts
decoding fresh from that point rather than revealing a backlog of
whatever was sent while it was off. Already-decoded text stays visible
until you clear it yourself (the panel's own **Clear** button) or
reconnect. Each extra receiver window has its own independent **CW
Decode** button and panel, next to that receiver's own CTUN.

[Settings: CW](06-settings-cw.md) has a **CW Pitch** slider (300-1000 Hz,
600 Hz by default) -- the audio pitch **CWL**/**CWU** centers on,
affecting the RX filter, click-to-tune centering above, and the TX Tune
tone. It's a single setting shared by the main receiver and every extra
receiver (no per-receiver override), since it's really "what pitch do you
want to hear/zero-beat CW at", not a per-receiver hardware setting. That
same tab also configures the radio's internal CW keyer (speed, weight,
sidetone, break-in) and up to 5 saved CW text messages.

## VFO A / VFO B / Split

![VFO A and VFO B boxes with buttons between them](images/02-vfo-ab.png)

Next to the **VFO-A** box is a second, independent **VFO-B** box -- a
second remembered frequency with no receiver of its own (this app doesn't
receive on two frequencies at once). You can scroll on the VFO-B box the
same way as VFO-A (Shift for 100 Hz steps, otherwise 1 kHz) to change its
stored value directly, or use the buttons between the two boxes:

- **A>B** -- copies VFO A's current frequency into VFO B.
- **B>A** -- retunes VFO A to VFO B's frequency (moving the CTUN listen
  point instead of the real hardware frequency if CTUN is on -- see
  above).
- **A<>B** -- swaps VFO A and VFO B.
- **Split** -- while enabled, transmit uses VFO B's frequency instead of
  VFO A's, while reception continues on VFO A as normal. The box that's
  actually red while transmitting follows whichever VFO is really in use
  -- VFO A normally, VFO B when Split is on -- so the highlight always
  points at what's really going out over the air.

## Bands and modes

One row of band buttons -- **160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m,
10m, 6m** -- jumps to that band's remembered frequency, mode, and filter
width (or sensible defaults the first time you visit a band). Each band
remembers its own settings independently as you use the app. A band whose
range the connected radio can't actually tune to doesn't get a button at
all -- e.g. HermesLite/HermesLite2 cap out around 30.72MHz, so **6m**
(50-54MHz) is missing on those boards. Same filtering applies to Settings
→ PA Calibration's per-band list and to extra receiver windows' own band
row.

An extra **Gen** button (general coverage) always appears after the ham
bands -- it covers the connected radio's *entire* tunable range, for
listening outside the ham allocations (broadcast, utility, WWV, etc.). It
works exactly like a real band otherwise: it remembers its own last
frequency/mode (defaulting to 10.000.000 Hz/AM, WWV/WWVH, the first time
you use it), and lights up as the selected "band" whenever the dial isn't
actually inside one of the ham bands above. Settings → Open Collector and
Settings → Antenna also treat **Gen** as a real, separately-configurable
band row -- see [Settings: Open Collector](12-open-collector.md).

A configured [transverter](18-xvtr.md) (Settings → **XVTR**) appears as an
extra button alongside the band row, showing the real RF frequency (e.g.
2m) while the radio's actual hardware stays tuned to its true IF
underneath -- see [Settings: XVTR](18-xvtr.md) for how to define one.

Below that, a row of mode buttons: **LSB, USB, DSB, CWL, CWU, FM, AM, DIGU,
SPEC, DIGL, SAM, DRM**.

Next to the mode row, **Filter width** sets the demodulator passband width
in Hz (50-5000 Hz). Each mode remembers its own last-used width.

## Audio gain

**Audio gain** controls the speaker/headphone volume for the received
audio (this is WDSP's own output gain stage, not your OS/sound-card
volume). The slider is scaled in dB (-100 to +18), so each step is an equal
relative loudness change across the whole range rather than the low end
being too coarse and the high end too fine on a plain linear scale.

## Noise/AGC toggles

A row of cycling buttons, each click advancing to the next state, plus one
slider:

- **NB** -- cycles Off → NB → NB2 → Off (two mutually-exclusive noise
  blanker stages; the threshold both share is in Settings → RX).
- **NR** -- cycles Off → NR → NR2 → NNR → Off (three mutually-exclusive
  noise reduction algorithms; NNR is WDSP's built-in neural-net noise
  reduction).
- **SNB** -- toggles the Spectral Noise Blanker on/off, independently of NB
  and NR (it can run alongside either).
- **ANF** -- toggles the Automatic Notch Filter on/off, independently of
  NB/NR/SNB. Targets a steady heterodyne/carrier within the passband, not
  broadband noise.
- **BIN** -- toggles binaural ("phasing") RX audio on/off: when on, the
  left and right audio channels genuinely differ (an intentional SDR
  stereo-listening effect), instead of the usual identical L/R. Needs
  headphones or stereo speakers to hear the effect.
- **AGC** -- cycles Off → Long → Slow → Medium → Fast → Off. Attack/decay/
  hang/top/slope for AGC are tuned in Settings → RX.
- **AGC Gain** (0.0-140.0 dB) -- right after the AGC button. The same value
  as Settings → RX's **Top** slider, under the name piHPSDR uses for it --
  raises or lowers the AGC's target output level.

![Noise and AGC toggle row](images/02-toggle-row.png)

## rigctl / TCI / CAT status badges

Small colored badges show whether the rigctl, TCI, and CAT control servers
(configured in Settings → Network) are running:

- Gray -- not running.
- Green -- listening, no client connected (or a PureSignal-specific state
  for the **PS** badge -- see below).
- Red -- a client is currently connected.

Hovering a badge shows its address and current state in a tooltip.

If PureSignal is enabled for the session, a **PS** badge also appears: gray
while enabled but not yet correcting, green while actively correcting, with
the current feedback level shown in the tooltip.

## Record

The **Record** button, next to the status badges, saves the RX audio
you're currently hearing to a WAV file -- exactly what the local speaker
plays, including Audio Gain and any noise reduction/blanker/AGC settings
in effect, muted the same way the speaker itself is during transmit. Click
it again (now labeled **Recording**, in red) to stop.

Files land in a `recordings` folder alongside this radio's other saved
settings -- `~/.config/hpsdr-rs/recordings/` (Linux),
`%APPDATA%\hpsdr-rs\recordings\` (Windows), or `~/Library/Application
Support/hpsdr-rs/recordings/` (macOS) -- named by when the recording
started plus which receiver it came from, e.g.
`hpsdr-rs_1788972349_main.wav`. Every [extra receiver
window](03-extra-receivers.md) has its own independent **Record** button
too -- its recordings land in the same folder, suffixed `rxN` instead of
`main` (e.g. `hpsdr-rs_1788972349_rx1.wav`), so simultaneous recordings
from different receivers never collide.

## Transmit controls

This row only appears once TX is armed (Settings → TX → **Enable
Transmit**).

By default, TX refuses to key at all outside the defined ham bands (e.g.
while parked on **Gen**) -- the **MOX** button greys out with an
explanatory tooltip, and the same block applies to **TUNE**, **TWO
TONE**, CW text send, and CAT/rigctl/TCI PTT commands. See [Settings:
TX](17-settings-tx.md#allow-tx-outside-ham-bands) for the override, if
you have your own authorization for out-of-band operation.

The controls themselves:

- **MOX** -- toggles transmit on/off. While active it turns red and reads
  **MOX ON**, and a red **TRANSMITTING** label appears.
- **TUNE** -- transmits a steady test tone, centered in the current filter
  passband, at the reduced **Tune Power %** set in Settings → TX (not full
  TX Power) -- for safely tuning an antenna or amplifier.
- **TWO TONE** -- transmits a two-tone test signal instead of a steady
  tone, also at Tune Power. This is required (not just an alternative) for
  PureSignal calibration -- see [PureSignal](14-puresignal.md).
- **RIT** (Receiver Incremental Tuning) -- nudges what you actually hear
  without touching VFO A's displayed or logged frequency, useful for
  zero-beating a station that's drifted slightly off frequency without
  moving your own dial.
- **XIT** (Transmitter Incremental Tuning) -- the TX-side equivalent:
  nudges your actual TX frequency without moving VFO A's (or VFO B's, if
  Split is on) displayed frequency.
- **RIT**/**XIT** both: click to toggle on/off; scroll while hovering to
  adjust the offset (Shift for 10 Hz steps, otherwise 100 Hz, clamped to
  ±9,999 Hz) -- the button's own label shows the current offset once it's
  non-zero (e.g. **RIT +250**); **Clear** zeros it. Independent of each
  other and of CTUN -- any combination can be on at once, and neither RIT
  nor XIT ever moves the CTUN listen point or the displayed VFO
  frequency.
- **Spacebar** is a hold-to-talk shortcut for MOX, active whenever no text
  field has keyboard focus.

While transmitting, a line beneath the gain controls shows **Mic level**
and **ALC** readouts, and Mic gain / TCI TX gain / TX Power sliders appear
alongside Audio gain.

**Always bench-test into a dummy load at reduced drive before transmitting
into a real antenna.** See the [top-level README](../../README.md) for the
project's current TX verification status.

![Transmit controls active](images/02-tx-active.png)

## Spectrum and waterfall

The spectrum pane shows the live signal trace with a shaded band marking
the current filter passband and a vertical line marking the dial frequency
-- blue while receiving, red/orange while transmitting (see
[Settings: Spectrum](16-settings-spectrum.md#while-transmitting) for what
changes about this while Split is in use). Ten frequency-axis gridlines
span the pane; the label at the very first and last one is skipped (the
gridline itself still draws) since it would otherwise get clipped or hang
off the edge. The waterfall pane below it shows the same signal scrolling
over time, colored by the selected palette (Settings → Spectrum).

Drag the thin divider between the two panes to adjust how much vertical
space each gets.

A small waveform display sits in the top-right corner of the spectrum
pane -- a quick visual check that audio is actually flowing, and roughly
what level it's at, without needing an external scope. It shows the
output audio while receiving, and while transmitting switches to whatever
is actually feeding TX right now (local mic, TCI, or the radio's own mic,
whichever is currently selected/active). It traces the RMS loudness
envelope over roughly the last half second (not raw min/max peaks, which
tend to render as a solid block for continuous voice), auto-scaled each
frame to the loudest moment in that window so it stays readable regardless
of the Audio Gain slider or mic input level.

### Zoom and Pan

Below the waterfall, **Zoom** (1x-16x, scroll-adjustable like every other
slider in this app) narrows the visible frequency
window symmetrically around the dial frequency (or, with
[CTUN](#ctun-click-to-tune) on, the CTUN listen frequency instead); **Pan**
then shifts that narrowed window left/right within the full receiver
bandwidth (it has no effect at 1x zoom -- there's nothing to pan to when
the full span is already shown). **Reset** returns to 1x/centered.

This is a real resolution increase, not just a visual stretch of the same
data: zooming in actually grows the underlying FFT size, so the spectrum
trace and waterfall genuinely resolve finer detail the further in you
zoom, the same way piHPSDR and rustyHPSDR's own zoom works. The
frequency-axis ticks and band-edge markers track the current Zoom/Pan
too, and clicking or scrolling to tune still targets the actual frequency
under the cursor/zoomed view, not the underlying full span.

## S-meter / power meter

Anchored in the top-right of the window:

- **Receiving**: a classic analog S-meter, S0-S9 in 6 dB steps, with
  +10..+60 over S9 shown in red. If it reads consistently high or low
  against a known reference signal, see Settings → RX's [S-Meter
  Cal](15-settings-rx.md#s-meter-cal) -- it also corrects the
  spectrum/waterfall's own dB scale, not just this numeric reading.
- **Transmitting**: forward/reverse power and SWR, scaled to your
  configured **Max TX Power** (Settings → TX). The needle is red whenever
  you're transmitting at all, and if SWR reaches or exceeds **Max SWR**
  (Settings → TX) at more than 35W, **TX Power** is automatically cut to
  10W to protect the PA -- see [Settings: TX](17-settings-tx.md#max-swr)
  for the full behavior.

Below the meter:

- **Settings...** opens the [Settings window](11-settings-network.md).
- **Add Receiver (n/max)** adds another independent receiver window (see
  [Extra Receivers](03-extra-receivers.md)) -- hidden once you've reached
  the radio's maximum receiver count, replaced with **All N receivers
  active**.

## Stopping

The **Stop** button at the bottom of the window disconnects from the radio
and returns to the discovery window.
