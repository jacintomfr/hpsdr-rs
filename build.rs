/*
    Builds WDSP from vendored C source (vendor/wdsp) instead of linking
    a prebuilt platform-specific binary -- file list originally ported
    from rustyHPSDR's own build.rs, which built the same source tree on
    both Linux and Windows (MSYS2/MinGW-w64).

    vendor/libspecbleach and vendor/rnnoise (which backed WDSP's NR4
    "SBNR" and NR3 "RNNR" noise-reduction stages) are NOT built --
    removed entirely (2026-09-08), along with the real DSP work inside
    vendor/wdsp/rnnr.c/sbnr.c that called into them (now inert stubs,
    see those files' own header comments). Neither stage was ever
    enabled by any Rust code in this project -- WDSP's own built-in
    neural-net stage ("NNR", vendor/wdsp/nnr.c + nnet.c/nnio.c + two
    compiled-in trained models) is what's actually wired up to the UI
    (labeled "NNR", not "NR3", to avoid confusion with the removed
    RNNoise-backed stage -- see spectrum.rs's NoiseReduction doc
    comment) -- see memory/wdsp_210_port.md for the full history.

    Confirmed viable cross-platform by reading the vendored source
    directly: wdsp/comm.h and wdsp/linux_port.h branch on
    `#if defined(linux) || defined(__APPLE__)` vs `#ifdef _WIN32` --  the
    Windows branch just pulls in the real <Windows.h>/<avrt.h>/<intrin.h>
    and uses real Win32 types (CRITICAL_SECTION, HANDLE, etc.) directly.
    That's WDSP's original Windows-native code path (Thetis's own
    platform); linux_port.c's pthread-based shims exist to fake that same
    Win32-shaped API on Linux/macOS, not the other way around -- so
    building under MinGW-w64 (which defines _WIN32, not linux) takes the
    same real-Windows-API path MSVC would, no extra porting needed here.
    Confirmed this ALSO means real MSVC (not just MinGW-w64) needs no C
    source changes at all -- MSVC defines _WIN32 exactly the same way,
    so it takes the identical code path. The only actual MSVC-specific
    work in this file is (1) compiler-flag selection, since the GCC-style
    flags below aren't understood by cl.exe, and (2) fftw3 discovery,
    since pkg-config isn't a native Windows tool -- see both below.

    NOTE on a bug this replaced: the three vendor .a files this used to
    link were confirmed (via `md5sum`/`nm`) to be three byte-identical
    copies of one combined archive, not three separate libraries --
    traced to rustyHPSDR's own build.rs calling `.compile()` three times
    on one cc::Build that already had every file from all three projects
    added to it, so each call redundantly recompiled everything under a
    different name. Fixed here by calling `.compile()` once.
